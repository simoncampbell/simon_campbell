He told me of a great deal on a pre-registered van, so asked him to mail me a picture; it arrived – the van was white!\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n	       “White van man” is a stereotype found in the United Kingdom of the driving of smaller-sized commercial vans, perceived as selfish, inconsiderate, or aggressive.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n	       Now white van man was given a terrible reputation by late 90’s articles in the Sun and quite honestly I didn’t want to be tarred with the White Van brush or anonomised. It however made great financial sense, so I bit the bullet and went ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       When it arrived I took it for a spin and something very strange happened. People gave way for me, kept their distance and treated me like a king of the road.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       The ‘back stage’ area of the TT is notoriously difficult to get into. I turn up in the van and was just waved straight through, no questions just a slight glimpse of fear on the eye.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       Park anywhere, stick the hazards on and you are above the law: you could be delivering frozen chips or repairing someones boiler. Cut someone up at a roundabout, pull in from the wrong lane, slam the brakes on at anytime. The road is your domain, you are invincible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       The mystery of what lies inside and the fact that the driver may potentially be a very nasty and aggressive individual turns even the most fierce police officer or traffic warden into over-ripe Camembert; smelly but very soft.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       The general public may curse, swear and wave their fists, but you stop, open the door and they instantly evaporate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	       So the upshot is I will never now be without a white van. White is clearly the new black…\r\n</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2013-06-21 10:56:04', '2013-12-03 15:43:18', '5000c677-c2b7-43a1-a167-6af2f67c4626');

As an aside I found this <a href=\"http://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/charles-watkins\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">lovely interview</a> with Charlie Watkins who was probably the grandaddy of all echo units.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>The TC 2290</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	  As soon I plugged this in I was in love. Rich, deep delay with the fantastic ‘ducking’ feature, that reduces the volume of the effect return based upon the level of input and further avoids the mess than can be caused by too much delay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Considering how old it is you immediately notice the lack of hiss and the actual delay ‘sounds’ lovely. It has a fantastic array of facilities and the main inputs and outputs are electronically balanced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Whoever designed this was clearly a guitarist into flexibility.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Of course, it also has loads of great time based sounds and can be used as a basic looper, but for me, the delay is king and for general use I tend to use mostly 400mS and ‘slapback’ 120mS delays. Of course for specific songs I use delays based on the tempo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Due to its age it sadly doesn’t respond to MIDI command control changes, just program control changes, which limits its modern world flexibility, but what it looses here, it more than makes up for in tone!!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    I recently bought an <a href=\"http://www.eventide.com/AudioDivision/Products/Harmonizer%20Effects%20Processors/Eclipse.aspx\">Eventide Eclipse</a> hoping to replace the 2290 with a more feature rich unit in a smaller 1u package, but it just doesn’t cut the mustard and have ended up adding this to the rack along with the <a href=\"http://www.lexiconpro.com/\">Lexicon PCM70</a> and 2290.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    So, 2290 for delay, PCM70 for reverbs and Eclipse for harmoniser and more bizarre effects.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Using the time based effects on a live rig</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	  The way I route the echo is really important and have found that using a unit at the front end, or even in an effects loop of your main amplifier, detracts from the punch and definition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  My thinking to solve this problem was to use a separate amp for the echo/time based effect return, so the direct signal comes out of your amp and the effect signal only comes through a separate amplifier system.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    It doesn’t however work well for everything. Chorus and flangers rely upon being mixed with the original signal to have the desired effect, hence to hear the full effect, you have to be: a reasonable distance from your rig when on stage, or rely on monitors! But of course the most important people, your audience, will hear the wonderful tone you are creating!\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Current iteration</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	  If you read any of my articles about a <a href=\"http://blog.simoncampbell.com/blog/perma/search_for_the_ultimate_tone_part_three/\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">search for the perfect tone</a> you can read about the whole convoluted journey, but if think about it, any time based effect need to take its source following distortions etc, and as I primarily use amp drive, my latest rig iteration uses a custom built DI / mixer unit from<a href=\"http://www.skrydstrup.com/\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">Steen Skrystrup</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Steen chose to use the ‘external speaker outs’ from amplifiers as the input to the unit; logical as virtually all amplifiers have this type of output. It can use simultaneously up to three amplifiers out of my current selection of BludoTone Bludodrive, Van Weelden TwinkleLand, Fender ProReverb, Ampeg Reverberocket or Germino JTM45.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    The unit isolates all the input grounds and converts the mixed signals to a pair of line level, balanced, feeds for the 2290, Eventide Eclipse and Lexicon PCM70 then summing the stereo outputs to feed an Amcron D75 driving two 1×12 EVM 12L Two Rock cabinets. It sounds complex but the sound it fantastic and worth the expense, hassle and lugging around!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    So there you are, a bit of an overview of the 2290 and the other time based effects!\r\n</p>', '[{\"col1\":\"TC Electronic \",\"col2\":\"http:\\/\\/www.tcelectronic.com\\/tc-2290\\/\"}]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2013-06-26 09:11:31', '2013-12-03 16:44:39', '2a0fcd1a-c8e7-423a-9fe9-177c84b100e5');

Rich, deep delay with the fantastic \\u2018ducking\\u2019 feature, that reduces the volume of the effect return based upon the level of input and further avoids the mess than can be caused by too much delay.<\\/span>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  Considering how old it is you immediately notice the lack of hiss and the actual delay \\u2018sounds\\u2019 lovely. It has a fantastic array of facilities and the main inputs and outputs are electronically balanced.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  Whoever designed this was clearly a guitarist into flexibility.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  Of course, it also has loads of great time based sounds and can be used as a basic looper, but for me, the delay is king and for general use I tend to use mostly 400mS and \\u2018slapback\\u2019 120mS delays. Of course for specific songs I use delays based on the tempo.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  Due to its age it sadly doesn\\u2019t respond to MIDI command control changes, just program control changes, which limits its modern world flexibility, but what it looses here, it more than makes up for in tone!!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  I recently bought an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.eventide.com\\/AudioDivision\\/Products\\/Harmonizer%20Effects%20Processors\\/Eclipse.aspx\\\">Eventide Eclipse<\\/a> hoping to replace the 2290 with a more feature rich unit in a smaller 1u package, but it just doesn\\u2019t cut the mustard and have ended up adding this to the rack along with the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.lexiconpro.com\\/\\\">Lexicon PCM70<\\/a> and 2290.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  So, 2290 for delay, PCM70 for reverbs and Eclipse for harmoniser and more bizarre effects.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Using the time based effects on a live rig<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">The way I route the echo is really important and have found that using a unit at the front end, or even in an effects loop of your main amplifier, detracts from the punch and definition.<\\/span>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">My thinking to solve this problem was to use a separate amp for the echo\\/time based effect return, so the direct signal comes out of your amp and the effect signal only comes through a separate amplifier system.<\\/span>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  It doesn\\u2019t however work well for everything. Chorus and flangers rely upon being mixed with the original signal to have the desired effect, hence to hear the full effect, you have to be: a reasonable distance from your rig when on stage, or rely on monitors! But of course the most important people, your audience, will hear the wonderful tone you are creating!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Current iteration<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">If you read any of my articles about a <\\/span><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.simoncampbell.com\\/blog\\/perma\\/search_for_the_ultimate_tone_part_three\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">search for the perfect tone<\\/a><span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\"> you can read about the whole convoluted journey, but if think about it, any time based effect need to take its source following distortions etc, and as I primarily use amp drive, my latest rig iteration uses a custom built DI \\/ mixer unit from<\\/span><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.skrydstrup.com\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">Steen Skrystrup<\\/a><span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">.<\\/span>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  Steen chose to use the \\u2018external speaker outs\\u2019 from amplifiers as the input to the unit; logical as virtually all amplifiers have this type of output.

Rich, deep delay with the fantastic \\u2018ducking\\u2019 feature, that reduces the volume of the effect return based upon the level of input and further avoids the mess than can be caused by too much delay.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Considering how old it is you immediately notice the lack of hiss and the actual delay \\u2018sounds\\u2019 lovely. It has a fantastic array of facilities and the main inputs and outputs are electronically balanced.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Whoever designed this was clearly a guitarist into flexibility.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Of course, it also has loads of great time based sounds and can be used as a basic looper, but for me, the delay is king and for general use I tend to use mostly 400mS and \\u2018slapback\\u2019 120mS delays. Of course for specific songs I use delays based on the tempo.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Due to its age it sadly doesn\\u2019t respond to MIDI command control changes, just program control changes, which limits its modern world flexibility, but what it looses here, it more than makes up for in tone!!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   I recently bought an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.eventide.com\\/AudioDivision\\/Products\\/Harmonizer%20Effects%20Processors\\/Eclipse.aspx\\\">Eventide Eclipse<\\/a> hoping to replace the 2290 with a more feature rich unit in a smaller 1u package, but it just doesn\\u2019t cut the mustard and have ended up adding this to the rack along with the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.lexiconpro.com\\/\\\">Lexicon PCM70<\\/a> and 2290.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   So, 2290 for delay, PCM70 for reverbs and Eclipse for harmoniser and more bizarre effects.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Using the time based effects on a live rig<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t The way I route the echo is really important and have found that using a unit at the front end, or even in an effects loop of your main amplifier, detracts from the punch and definition.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t My thinking to solve this problem was to use a separate amp for the echo\\/time based effect return, so the direct signal comes out of your amp and the effect signal only comes through a separate amplifier system.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   It doesn\\u2019t however work well for everything. Chorus and flangers rely upon being mixed with the original signal to have the desired effect, hence to hear the full effect, you have to be: a reasonable distance from your rig when on stage, or rely on monitors! But of course the most important people, your audience, will hear the wonderful tone you are creating!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Current iteration<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t If you read any of my articles about a <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.simoncampbell.com\\/blog\\/perma\\/search_for_the_ultimate_tone_part_three\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">search for the perfect tone<\\/a> you can read about the whole convoluted journey, but if think about it, any time based effect need to take its source following distortions etc, and as I primarily use amp drive, my latest rig iteration uses a custom built DI \\/ mixer unit from<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.skrydstrup.com\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">Steen Skrystrup<\\/a>.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Steen chose to use the \\u2018external speaker outs\\u2019 from amplifiers as the input to the unit; logical as virtually all amplifiers have this type of output. It can use simultaneously up to three amplifiers out of my current selection of BludoTone Bludodrive, Van Weelden TwinkleLand, Fender ProReverb, Ampeg Reverberocket or Germino JTM45.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   The unit isolates all the input grounds and converts the mixed signals to a pair of line level, balanced, feeds for the 2290, Eventide Eclipse and Lexicon PCM70 then summing the stereo outputs to feed an Amcron D75 driving two 1\\u00d712 EVM 12L Two Rock cabinets. It sounds complex but the sound it fantastic and worth the expense, hassle and lugging around!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   So there you are, a bit of an overview of the 2290 and the other time based effects!\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"24\":[\"18\"],\"18\":[{\"col1\":\"TC Electronic \",\"col2\":\"http:\\/\\/www.tcelectronic.com\\/tc-2290\\/\"}],\"16\":[{\"col1\":\"Ebay.com\",\"col2\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ebay.com\\/sch\\/i.html?_kw=TC+electronic+2290+Delay\",\"col3\":\"1500\"}],\"5\":\"The mighty and totally classy digital delay\",\"3\":\"My sound has featured delay (read echo) for a very long time indeed and as my guitar setup has evolved, has become a key feature of my playing.

As an aside I found this <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.namm.org\\/library\\/oral-history\\/charles-watkins\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">lovely interview<\\/a> with Charlie Watkins who was probably the grandaddy of all echo units.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>The TC 2290<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  As soon I plugged this in I was in love. Rich, deep delay with the fantastic \\u2018ducking\\u2019 feature, that reduces the volume of the effect return based upon the level of input and further avoids the mess than can be caused by too much delay.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Considering how old it is you immediately notice the lack of hiss and the actual delay \\u2018sounds\\u2019 lovely. It has a fantastic array of facilities and the main inputs and outputs are electronically balanced.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Whoever designed this was clearly a guitarist into flexibility.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Of course, it also has loads of great time based sounds and can be used as a basic looper, but for me, the delay is king and for general use I tend to use mostly 400mS and \\u2018slapback\\u2019 120mS delays. Of course for specific songs I use delays based on the tempo.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Due to its age it sadly doesn\\u2019t respond to MIDI command control changes, just program control changes, which limits its modern world flexibility, but what it looses here, it more than makes up for in tone!!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    I recently bought an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.eventide.com\\/AudioDivision\\/Products\\/Harmonizer%20Effects%20Processors\\/Eclipse.aspx\\\">Eventide Eclipse<\\/a> hoping to replace the 2290 with a more feature rich unit in a smaller 1u package, but it just doesn\\u2019t cut the mustard and have ended up adding this to the rack along with the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.lexiconpro.com\\/\\\">Lexicon PCM70<\\/a> and 2290.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    So, 2290 for delay, PCM70 for reverbs and Eclipse for harmoniser and more bizarre effects.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Using the time based effects on a live rig<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  The way I route the echo is really important and have found that using a unit at the front end, or even in an effects loop of your main amplifier, detracts from the punch and definition.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  My thinking to solve this problem was to use a separate amp for the echo\\/time based effect return, so the direct signal comes out of your amp and the effect signal only comes through a separate amplifier system.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    It doesn\\u2019t however work well for everything. Chorus and flangers rely upon being mixed with the original signal to have the desired effect, hence to hear the full effect, you have to be: a reasonable distance from your rig when on stage, or rely on monitors! But of course the most important people, your audience, will hear the wonderful tone you are creating!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Current iteration<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  If you read any of my articles about a <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.simoncampbell.com\\/blog\\/perma\\/search_for_the_ultimate_tone_part_three\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">search for the perfect tone<\\/a> you can read about the whole convoluted journey, but if think about it, any time based effect need to take its source following distortions etc, and as I primarily use amp drive, my latest rig iteration uses a custom built DI \\/ mixer unit from<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.skrydstrup.com\\/\\\" style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">Steen Skrystrup<\\/a>.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Steen chose to use the \\u2018external speaker outs\\u2019 from amplifiers as the input to the unit; logical as virtually all amplifiers have this type of output. It can use simultaneously up to three amplifiers out of my current selection of BludoTone Bludodrive, Van Weelden TwinkleLand, Fender ProReverb, Ampeg Reverberocket or Germino JTM45.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    The unit isolates all the input grounds and converts the mixed signals to a pair of line level, balanced, feeds for the 2290, Eventide Eclipse and Lexicon PCM70 then summing the stereo outputs to feed an Amcron D75 driving two 1\\u00d712 EVM 12L Two Rock cabinets. It sounds complex but the sound it fantastic and worth the expense, hassle and lugging around!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    So there you are, a bit of an overview of the 2290 and the other time based effects!\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"24\":[\"18\"],\"18\":[{\"col1\":\"TC Electronic \",\"col2\":\"http:\\/\\/www.tcelectronic.com\\/tc-2290\\/\"}],\"16\":[{\"col1\":\"Ebay.com\",\"col2\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ebay.com\\/sch\\/i.html?_kw=TC+electronic+2290+Delay\",\"col3\":\"1500\"}],\"5\":\"The mighty and totally classy digital delay\",\"3\":\"My sound has featured delay (read echo) for a very long time indeed and as my guitar setup has evolved, has become a key feature of my playing.
