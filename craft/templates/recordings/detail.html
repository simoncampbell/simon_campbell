        <p class="lede lede--large">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</p>

        <p>He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>

A golden dream, a child so fair,
A fine wine drank in my favourite chair,
A love for life – a love for truth,
A signal back to my frantic youth.

I got the power, I got the speed,
I got every little thing I need,
Life is for real, no second chance,
I take it all, I take my stance,
So I don’t care if you don’t know where I’m at,
’Cause babe I like it like that.

A thousand wishes, a thousand dreams,
A thousand lives, a thousand schemes,
A thousand ways to show my affection,
All leading in the same direction.

Five hundred years of war and peace,
I see it all but have no release,
Five hundred victims, five hundred screams,
I hear them nightly in my dreams…

I ain’t got no sense of humour,
I ain’t got no time for you,
You would need another life to do the things I’m gon’ to do
I can see right through you woman
You’re a vixen I can tell
Goin’ to eat your pretty heart out woman
I’m as hot as hell.

Tell your momma I’m a comin’
Goin’ to steal your heart away
You can fill a million novels with the things I’m goin to say
Got you round my little finger
Got you caught up in my spell
Goin’ to burn your pretty fingers babe
I’m as hot as hell.

Well your daddy’s out a boozin
And your mommas on the game
Got me layin’ on your pillow
You don’t even know my name
Goin’ a hawkin’ and a talkin’
Ain’t got nothin’ left to sell, oh no
Goin’ to work your skinny ass off babe

Leave me the water, I’ve had enough wine,
Babe I’ve been doin’ lots of thinkin’,
‘Cause I’ve had so much time,
Perhaps you do, perhaps you don’t,
But have you still got time to be my babe…

Leave me the water, I’ve had enough wine,
Babe I’ve been doin’ lots of thinkin’,
‘Cause I’ve had so much time,
Perhaps you do, perhaps you don’t,
But have you still got time to be my babe…

I don’t see enough of you babe,
But I think about you all the time,
And honey you know when we’re together,
Those moments are so damn fine,
And in my mind and in my heart,
I’ve still got time to be your babe…

You talk of leaving me, but I know this can’t be true
Because the only thing that matters babe,
Is that you love me, and I love you,
I know you do, so I know you wont,
Still got time to be your babe…
